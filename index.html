        <h1>Costa Rica</h1>
        <p>Winter is coming, which, for those of us living in the Pacific Northwest, means short days, dark clouds, rain, freezing temperatures, and the longing for spring to return.</p>
      </div>
        <p>It's usually around the new year that I start to crave warm, sandy beaches, sunny skies, clear blue water, tropical drinks and a sunburn. This year, Costa Rica is on top of my list of tropical paradises I'd like to migrate south to.</p>
        <h2>Why Costa Rica?</h2>
        <p>Um..Why <em>not</em> Costa Rica? Look how beautiful it is:</p>

        <h2>Stories from Costa Rica</h2>
        <p>I have a few friends and family members who have already been to Costa Rica. Here is what they had to say about it:</p>
